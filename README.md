# ხარჯი — Xarji

Self-hosted finance manager for Georgian banks.

## The Problem

Georgian banks don't provide public APIs for accessing transaction data. There's no way to programmatically track your spending, build budgets, or analyze your finances. You're stuck with whatever the bank's app shows you — no exports, no integrations, no control.

But banks do send SMS notifications for every transaction.

## The Solution

Xarji reads bank SMS notifications from your Mac's Messages app, parses the transaction details, and syncs them to your own InstantDB instance. You get a real-time dashboard with analytics, category breakdowns, and full control over your financial data.

Your data never touches third-party servers — everything runs locally on your machine.

```
Messages.app → xarji service (parses SMS) → InstantDB (your account) → xarji client (dashboard)
```

## Supported Banks

- Bank of Georgia / Solo
- TBC Bank
- Liberty Bank
- Credo Bank
- Basis Bank
- Tera Bank
- Custom sender IDs

## Prerequisites

- macOS (Messages app is the data source)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime
- Free [InstantDB](https://instantdb.com) account
- Bank SMS notifications enabled on your Mac

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tornikegomareli/Xarji.git
cd Xarji/service
bun install
bun run setup
```

The setup wizard walks you through everything:

1. Paste your InstantDB App ID and Admin Token
2. Pick your banks from the list
3. It checks macOS Full Disk Access
4. Generates all config and env files
5. Pushes the database schema to InstantDB

Then start the client:

```bash
cd ../client
bun install
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## Usage

**Start the service (foreground):**

```bash
cd service && bun run start
```

**Install as background daemon (auto-starts on login):**

```bash
cd service && bun run install-service
```

**Other commands:**

```bash
bun run status       # check service status
bun run test-parse   # test SMS parsing without syncing
```
